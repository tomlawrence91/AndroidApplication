Core Actions from our last meeting: 

- Create a plan, implementation -> integration -> finished product
- Look at technologies we need
- Leave the authentication for now and focus on the backend and planning of the application
- Look at new issues to integrate
- Clarify which platforms we will use and ensure we are both aligned
- Define how fat or slim the front end is
- Be very clear about the purpose of the project from the outset
- Reduce and provide constraints for everything
