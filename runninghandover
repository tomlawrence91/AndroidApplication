Running Handover: 

TL working on Database (as suggested by RDL I am going to leave the authentication for now)
AP working on

Core Actions from our last meeting: 

- Create a plan, implementation -> integration -> finished product
- Look at technologies we need
- Leave the authentication for now and focus on the backend and planning of the application
- Look at new issues to integrate
- Clarify which platforms we will use and ensure we are both aligned
- Define how fat or slim the front end is
- Be very clear about the purpose of the project from the outset
- Reduce and provide constraints for everything 

1) Give RDL access to repository on Github
2) Keep separate documentation and have access to everything in the code repository, not just in the wiki
3) Concentrate on 1/3 of the user stories
4) Create and structure the database based on the requirements of the user stories
5) Arrange a call with Dan every month
  a) Create a back up strategy for Dan - another customer or community/company outreach
6) Add in evaluation stages into the GANT chart
7) Target a niche and define it in the documentation
8) Make sure we have an electronic logbook
9) Make sure we have agendas for all the meetings
10) Make sure we provide minutes for all the meetings
